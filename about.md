Automated status updates to the GAD Bot Twitter account are made using the [twitteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) R package in a [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow. It is maintained by Sean Maden, PhD (GitHub: [metamaden](https://github.com/metamaden), Twitter: [@MadenSean](https://twitter.com/MadenSean)).
